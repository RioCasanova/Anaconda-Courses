    "PyScript is an innovative platform that allows you to run Python code directly in a web browser. It is particularly notable for its use of WebAssembly (WASM), a binary format that enables code written in languages other than JavaScript to be executed in the browser. This technology allows developers to utilize Python for front-end web development, effectively bypassing the need for a server-side backend."
